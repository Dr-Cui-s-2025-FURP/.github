### :thumbsup: Good Practice
We strongly encourage all contributors to make full use of Git for version control. This not only ensures a robust workflow but also serves as valuable practice for your software engineering skills.

To help you get started or to serve as a quick reference, here's a handy [Git cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) provided by GitHub Education. It covers the most common Git commands and workflows that you'll likely use while contributing to this project.

Remember, becoming proficient with Git is a crucial skill in your software engineering toolkit. It allows for better collaboration, code management, and understanding of the software development lifecycle.
